                        <p>FDA states that, a dietary supplement is a product intended for ingestion that contains a "dietary ingredient" intended to add further nutritional value to (supplement) the diet. A <strong>"dietary ingredient"</strong> may be one, or any combination, of the following substances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a vitamin</li>
                            <li>a mineral</li>
                            <li>an herb or other botanical</li>
                            <li>an amino acid</li>
                            <li>a dietary substance for use by people to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake</li>
                            <li>a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, or extract</li>
                        </ul>

Some dietary supplements can help ensure that you get an adequate dietary intake of essential nutrients; others may help you reduce the risk of disease.</p>
