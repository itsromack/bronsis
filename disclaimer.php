                        THIS UNIQUE TECHNIQUE OF VIEWING LIVE BLOOD IS NOT A DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE FOR A SPECIFIC DISEASE.  
                        IT IS A SCREENING TEST TO REFLECT HOW ONE’S DIET AND LIFESTYLE MAY BE INFLUENCING HEALTH. FOR OUR PURPOSES, WE SIMPLY WANT TO VIEW THE “TERRAIN” OF THE BLOOD TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE OVERALL “TOXIC LOAD” AND CONSEQUENT STATE OF HEALTH OF OUR CLIENT. 
                        IT CAN OFTEN POINT YOU IN A DIRECTION TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS WHICH OPTIMIZE HEALTH AND PREVENT THE ONSET OF DISEASE. HEALTH PROBLEMS AND DEGENERATIVE CONDITIONS CAN BE PREVENTED WITH EARLY NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTION.
