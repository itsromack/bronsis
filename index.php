                <h3>Basic information about blood, cells (red  blood) and LBCA.</h3>
                <p>Blood is the main transportation mechanism of the body. The tissues receive oxygen from the lungs and the lungs receive the by product, carbon dioxide, for exhalation. Nutrient and metabolites are also transported to the tissues. Without a doubt, blood is the fluid of life.</p>
                <p>Red blood cell are red because they contain protein known as hemoglobin. As blood passes though the lungs, oxygen molecules attach themselves to the hemoglobin. As blood flows through the body, the hemoglobin releases the oxygen to the cells.</p>
                <p>Blood is the fluid of health, transporting disease-fighting substances to the tissues. White blood cells are an integral part of the immune system. When a germ or infection enters the body, the white blood cells race towards “the scene of the crime.” They also act as lookouts for signs of trouble.</p>
                <p>There are various types of white blood cells, each with distinctive and complementary functions. The most common types of white blood cells in the blood are classified as either granular or  non-granular. Traditional blood tests rely on counts and ratios to determine if there are issues.</p>

                <h3>What is normal blood cell?</h3>
                <p>Normal blood cell are predominantly round not oval, oblong, jagged, or varying in size. When blood is perfectly balanced or in other term is homeostasis, the blood cells are loose and free flowing. Their colour is quite dark and slightly lightend in the center because red blood cell are actually biconcave disk. The red blood cells are all uniform in size approximately seven microns.</p>
                
                <h3>Blood cell abnormalities?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <dt>Poikilocytes</dt>
                    <dd>are red blood cell that have edges shaped like a bottle cap.</dd>
                  <dt>Macrocytosis</dt>
                    <dd>a substantial proportion of the red blood ells are bigger than seven microns in diameter.</dd>
                  <dt>Echicnocytes</dt>
                    <dd>are red blood cells with sharp or spikes. These red blood cells are dying.</dd>
                  <dt>Schistocytes</dt>
                    <dd>are red blood cells with damaged cell membranes.</dd>
                  <dt>Protein linkage</dt>
                    <dd>is the first incation that the body’s ability to digest is impaired.</dd>
                  <dt>Rouleau</dt>
                    <dd>this alignment is often referred to as stacked red blood cells because the red blood cells appear to be piled on each other.</dd>
                  <dt>Erythocyte, aggregation</dt>
                    <dd>is a more severe finding than protein linkage or rouleau.</dd>
                  <dt>Leukocytes (white blood cells)</dt>
                    <dd>are one of the body’s primary defences against disease and infection. Normal blood cell contains approximately one white blood cell for every seven hundred to nine hundred  red.</dd>
                  <dt>Thrombocyte aggregation</dt>
                    <dd>is an abnormal grouping. Are more commonly referred to as platelets.</dd>
                  <dt>Bacterial form</dt>
                    <dd>the plasma debris.</dd>
                  <dt>Spicules or fibrin</dt>
                    <dd>the most common to be liver and colon stress.</dd>
                  <dt>Crystal formation</dt>
                    <dd>these unusual and brightly coloured occurrences appear quite striking.</dd>
                  <dt>Photoplast</dt>
                    <dd>a cell without nucleus, and look like rocks in the blood plasma and can be round or oblong, they also can have smooth or jagged edges.</dd>
                </ul>

                <h3>State how important is the live blood cell analysis?</h3>

                <p>The reason we use blood is because blood is a very unique substance with very unique properties.</p>

                <p>Nutritional microscopy is  more of a process than a procedure. Microscopy means employing a microscope for investigation and assessment, nutritional is self-explanatory. It would be a mistake however, to assume that nutritional microscopy is simply using a microscope to scientifically determine nutritional deficiencies.</p>

                <p>Live blood cell analysis is a part of nutritional microscopy session appears quite straightforward in nature. A drop of blood is painlessly extracted from the client’s body usually from the finger. The finger is not squeezed to assure that the sample is not damaged. The capillary blood is allowed to come out on its own and then immediately placed between two pieces of pre-cleaned glass. The blood begins to slowly dry out however it is protected from oxygen by the glass long enough to allow the assessment to be completed. Technically , this is known as wet-mount examination or a peripheral blood smear.</p>
